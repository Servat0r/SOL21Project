# Syntax is: <param_name> = <value>, where <param_name> is a character that can be followed
# by a sequence of alphanumeric characters, and <value> can contain ANY character.
# The value '?' means that this attribute is NOT specified.
# Any unrecognized attribute is ignored by the parser.
# There MUST be spaces between any variable name and its value (otherwise it is generated
# an error) in order to simplify parsing of the file.
